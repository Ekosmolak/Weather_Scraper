,Collect Data,"Code successfully scrapes the min, max & mean temperature and date, and stores them in a dictionary of dictionaries.",,6,,,,,,
,Detect End,"Code successfully scrapes weather data from the current date, as far back in time as is available. Last available weather date should be automatically detected in some way, not hard coded.",,6,,,,,,
,I/O,"Code receives a url to scrape as input, and outputs the scraped data for use in other parts of the program.",,6,,,,,,
Database,Name,A class named DBOperations has been created inside a db_operations module.,,4,,,,,,
,Context Manager,Code uses a database context manager named DBCM correctly. DBCM returns a cursor object in __enter__. DBCM commits changes and closes all connection objects in __exit__,,4,,,,,,
,Initialise,"Code successfully initializes the database and creates the necessary tables/fields if they don't already exist, every time the pro? gram starts.",,4,,,,,,
,Store,"Code receives & processes date, min, max & mean temperature as input, checks for duplicates in some way, and successfully stores it in the database.",,4,,,,,,
